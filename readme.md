Yes, ✅ all JavaScript objects must have values in key-value pairs.

That means every value inside an object must be tied to a key (or property name).

const ride = rideModel.create({
    user,
    pickup,
    destination,
    fare: fare[vehicleType]   
    
    Either you explicitly define  the key or just pass the props in sequence 
    
})

Great question!
In Express, when you use route-level middleware and validators, the array syntax is needed if you want to pass multiple middleware functions as a group.
